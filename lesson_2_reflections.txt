1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The folder becomes a git repository and after that git will start tracking all commits in this folder.


2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area only has files that were added into it instead of containing all files in working directory. It is a simulation environment before publishing to the actual repository so that we can test it out.
